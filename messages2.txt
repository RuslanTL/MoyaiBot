i
used
to
think
that
i
had
perfect
pitch
because
i'm
pretty
good
at
recognising
notes
on
their
own
but
apparently
that's
not
the
only
thing
his
wife
could
be
giving
birth
and
he
would
be
like
“the
sound
of
the
baby
violently
sliding
out

your

is
an
A#
moving

to

he's
such

his

is
wack
https://tenor.com/view/the-simpsons-homer-simpson-nerd-yelling-insult-gif-7884166
have
you
ever
seen
what
clothes
he
wears
and
his

haircut
that
looks

well
my

about
his

still

he
looks
like
an

8
year
old
with
that
cut
<:troll:885642031622418433>
TRINITY
!?
i
guess
my
contempt
towards
him
just
comes
from
the
fact
that
he
makes
very
complicated
music
theory
wise
and
to
me
that
reflects
a
very
high-brow
audience
very
bourgeoise
yeah
I
hate
that
<@!359784314981974017>
went

search
him
up
and
"based

idk
what
it
is
about
modern

fusion
(white

jazz)
but
it
feels
like
such
a
pretentious
genre
it
is
i
guess
its
because
it's
meant
to
be
listened
to
by
the
same
type
of
people
IDK
i
just
fucking
hate
music
theory
thats
all
LOL
its
hard
to
explain
but
the
modern
concept
of
music
theory
just
feels
racist
to
me
because
it
was
based
on
the
music
that
the
european
"greats"
wrote
like
300
years
ago
and
now
im
just
repeating
adam
neely's
video
on
why
music
theory
is
racist
but
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
today
people
are
still
using
this
old
classical
theory
to
make
new
music
and
it's
hard
to
not
do
that
because
our
entire
system
of
music
making
is
based
around
it

i
also
still
have
no
idea
what
robbies
deal
is
whats
up
with
robbie
i
talked
to
nick
about
robbie
a
month
ago
or
so
i
remember
knowing
that
he
has
everything
sorted
out
now
but
i
barely
remember
the
conversation
<:troll:704465320525692958>
well
being
told
that
nick
was
leaving
"indefinitely"
by
dragnar
in
an
announcement
and
seeing
him
back
less
than
a
month
later
is
interesting
i
still
really
dont
like
how
evasive
he
was
when
no
one
knew
if
he
was
a
predator
but
in
hindsight
it
was
his
right
not
to
say
anything
about
it
that
still
doesnt
make
him
an
honest
person
from
our
perspective
which
is
not
the
type
of
person
that
I
would
like
in
charge
of
a
large
community
that
im
apart
of

<@!195341565089153026>
oh
here
it
said
something
lets
wait
now
to
see
when
it's
gonna
say
it
next
yeah
i
just
wish
i
hadnt
acted
so
crudely
toward
him
then
maybe
he
would
be
more
receptive
if
i
actually
confronted
him
about
it
if
the
rest
of
the
administration
team
knew
about
that
and
they
didnt
do
anything....
it
kind
of
makes
me
question
the
integrity
of
that
team.
fast
forward
to
over
a
week
ago
when
i
found
out
about
what
dragnar
was
doing
dont
second
guess
yourself.
you're
in
the
right
from
my
point
of
view
though
I
think
it
would
be
best
to
continue
to
distance
ourselves
from
that
server
and
build
our
own
community
aye
my
opinion
of
the
mod
team
ranges
from
theyre
slighty
annoying
to
they're
unbearable
i
just
wish
everyone
in
the
cs
server
was
in
moyai
collective
lol
there
are
cool
peeps
in
cs
yeah
and
we
can
do
that
we
just
have
to
make
it
worthwhile
true
i
forgot
how
much
i
liked
hosting
feedback
streams
but
its
kind
of
a
once
in
a
blue
moon
thing
for
me
now
its
sooo
much
work
and
if
the
community
isnt
nice
its
really
not
fun
at
all
Ok
so
we
should
step
up
positive
vibes
obv
treat
others
as
you'd
want
to
be
treated
I
get
different
energy
between
Chillsynth
and
Auxy
streams
yeah
tbh
if
everyone
is
really
respectful
and
supportive
and
the
focus
is
on
people's
music
its
a
good
time
for
everybody
and
thats
probably
reason
#12
exactly
you're
really
good
at
finding
great
things
to
say
about
tracks
that
are
lacking
from
inexperienced
producers
listening
to
primitive
auxy
songs
is
just
my
guilty
pleasure
awesomeness
they
make
me
nostalgic
<:troll:704465320525692958>
hehe
also
getting
the
community
members
that
are
at
first
shy
and
anxious
to
be
extremely
open
is
a
great
thing
to
boost
server
positivity
okay
yeah
it's
better
to
do
this
another
way
and
explaining
to
the
submitter
how
the
system
works
is
a
good
idea
i
honestly
love
that
that
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
part
basically
its
a
feedback
stream
and
anything
that
needs
feedback
and
work
is
welcome
and
encouraged
yeah
fr
ok
perhaps
ill
experiment
for
a
bit
with
a
twitch
channel
